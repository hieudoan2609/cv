# On meaning & programming

Coding has taught me the most important lesson that a mere mortal can ever possibly strive to learn from this short and uncertain fleeting experience that the Merriam Webster’s dictionary conveniently labels “life”.

Something so profound that mere words are just not going to do it justice, that just by putting it in language, somehow I’m betraying it.

Something that great men of human civilization such as William Shakespeare, Ernest Hemingway or Edgar Allan Poe struggled to convey through their works but destined to fail in doing so.

Something much more profound than critical thinking, logic, the ability to make money while laying on a hammock in the shadow of a palm tree on some exotic beach while sipping an ice cold pina colada or solving complex world problems through making apps and websites.

It has taught me what true love is about.

For the first time in my life, I could understand what Rose felt the moment she held Jack’s cold, pale hands while staring into his fading eyes as he was shrinking down deeper and deeper into the ocean in Titanic, what Melanie and Ashley felt the moment they reunited after the civil war in Gone with the Wind, a willingness to give your lives to one another all the way, everyday, uptil death.

Thank you for reading.
